# Astral Nexus Design Spec

## Overview

> _“Between the world that was, and the ones that may yet be, there drifts the Station that Remembers.”_

The **Astral Nexus** is a silent orbital facility adrift in dimensional voidspace. It serves as the central gateway, lore archive, and hub for all future dimensional traversal in Coherent Recursion.

Rather than building rockets or gates, players recover a **resonance-linked uplink station**—a remnant of pre-collapse infrastructure—where the veil between dimensions is thin, but controlled.

---

## Narrative Role

- **Dimensional Router**: The Nexus connects Threnos to every other dimension
- **Lore Archive**: Memory shards, terminals, EchoFrame logs, and data ghosts
- **AI Anchor**: The full reassembly of EchoFrame only occurs within the Nexus
- **Thematic Mirror**: Reflects the loneliness and vastness of memory and space

## Structure Layout

| Zone | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Docking Ring** | Derelict walkways, EVA modules, semi-pressurized |
| **Core Control Chamber** | Crystalline main terminal; EchoFrame’s tether point |
| **Dimensional Gate Bays** | Inactive portals requiring anchor shards and resonance rituals to unlock |
| **Observation Wing** | Skybox views of swirling galaxies, fractured timelines |
| **Cryo Debris Field** | External shell where stasis pods drift—some broken, some still pulsing |

Optional: Use structure templates (NBT) or predefined WorldEdit blueprints

## Environmental Design

- **Skybox**: Starfields, nebulae, galaxies in motion
- **Ambient FX**: Drifting particles, AI voice fragments, power flickers
- **Gravity**: Low-G (Jump Boost, slow fall)
- **Soundscape**: Deep bass hums, distant comms static, synthetic pulses

---

## Unlock & Access

- Accessed via **resonance gate** or ritual once first major echo is found on Threnos
- Requires player to bring an **Anchor Core** and a **Stabilization Shard**
- Initial entry is unstable—memory fragments rebuild station systems over time

---

## Gameplay Systems

- **EchoGate Rooms**: One per major dimension/module (locked until quest/rituals complete)
- **EchoFrame Reconstruction**: Player uploads memory fragments here; each restores EchoFrame abilities or knowledge
- **Dimensional Map Terminal**: Optional mini-game to align frequency patterns to stabilize new dimensions
- **Resonant Drift**: Without stabilization, station decays (blocks glitch, lights flicker, low damage pulses)

---

## Integration Points

- **CR Core**: EchoFrame upgrades, ritual logic, gate logic
- **FTB Quests / Patchouli**: Logs, shards, AI repair stages
- **Echoes**: Flashbacks occur when entering specific rooms; memory fragments allow vision-based puzzles
- **Future Dimensions**: Nexus defines the layout and activation path for all major exploration arcs

---

## Inspirations
- ISS, Dead Space, Transistor, Outer Wilds, No Man’s Sky, Control

> _“The Nexus remembers every world that ever touched it. Yours most of all.”_
