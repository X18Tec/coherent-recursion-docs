# The Weight of What We Waste

> _Recovered fragment from the Echo Vaults – Location Unknown_

---

The ancients did not fear death. They feared **forgetting.**

In Aetherion’s final century, they learned that even discarded things had **resonance**. A stone once carved, a tool once wielded, a meal half-eaten—each held a trace of identity. They called this **the Liminal Imprint**, the echo left behind by use, intention, and abandonment.

When the auroras began to fade, it wasn’t the great machines that failed first. It was the soil. The water. The silence in the halls of memory.

Too much had been lost—**not to time**, but to **neglect**.

> “The world remembers not just what we build—but what we waste.”

They began to notice shadows forming near old drop pits. Black moss growing where unused ores piled. Ghostly silhouettes watching in regions where rituals had been abandoned mid-casting. These were not monsters.

They were **consequences.**

No vault could hold them. No fortress could keep them out. Because they were **born inside the act of forgetting itself**.

Aetherion fell not from invasion, nor from failure.
It fell because it stopped remembering what mattered.

And now the world itself forgets.

Until you remind it.
