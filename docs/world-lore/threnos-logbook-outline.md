# Threnos Logbook (Dynamic Player Codex)

> _“You cannot remember everything at once. But the world remembers for you.”_

The **Threnos Logbook** is a modular player journal that expands as the player rediscovers memory fragments, lore, dimensional knowledge, and EchoFrame logs. It is not simply a wiki—it is a **narrative memory reconstruction system** integrated into gameplay.

## 📖 Format & Delivery

| Source | Delivery Method |
|--------|------------------|
| EchoFrame boot logs | Auto-triggered when memory restored |
| Found lore fragments | Patchouli entries (book auto-updates) |
| Dimensional unlocks | Codex entries for each realm |
| Ritual completions | Short reflections or warnings added to journal |
| Vision events | Flashback content described and logged |

---

## 🧠 Core Sections

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Echoes of Aetherion** | History of the collapse, mythos of the world |
| **Fragments of Threnos** | Biomes, anomalies, local instability logs |
| **Dimensional Index** | Info on unlocked dimensions, rituals, gates |
| **EchoFrame Logs** | AI commentary, system logs, warnings, dreams |
| **You Were Here** | Player actions that trigger memory alignment (like achievements, but emotional) |

## 📚 Example Entries

### EchoFrame Entry #002: Cryofault Analysis
> “The rock sings. It is not supposed to. That canyon below the vault—it’s humming. Either the leyline is misaligned or time is bleeding again.”

### Memory Fragment - Orchard A
> “I remember apples. No one else ate them. I’m sure that tree wasn’t here when I left.”

### Dimensional Entry: Echo Depths
> “You descended not into darkness, but into dissonance. The walls remember being elsewhere. So do you.”
