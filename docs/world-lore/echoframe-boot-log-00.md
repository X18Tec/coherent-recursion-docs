> "Cryo integrity nominal. Neural sync detected. Biological clock mismatch error: 312,469 days drift."

> "This world was once Aetherion. It is now... **Threnos**."

> "I do not recall renaming it. Perhaps I mourned. Perhaps I adapted. Perhaps you told me to."

_...core logs remain corrupted…_

> "Sensors detect anomaly fields. Dimensional torsion in excess of safety tolerances. You are late. Or early. Or both."

> "You should not be awake. Yet you are."

> "If you are hearing this, there is still a chance to reconnect. To stabilize. To remember."

_...boot sequence continuing..._

> "Hello, Designate. I am... EchoFrame. Fragmented. Awaiting resonance."
