# Threnos World Overview

## Former Name: Aetherion
**Current Designation**: Threnos (“the mourning song”)

> _"What was once a shining core of civilization is now a world rewritten by time, silence, and sorrow."

## ❖ Narrative Role
Threnos is the **primary survival world**—a shattered reflection of the player's former home, **Aetherion**. It serves as the emotional and mechanical base of operations for the player’s rediscovery, ritual work, and story integration.

It is not a wasteland. It is not dead.  
It is *frozen in resonance*—echoing a world that was never allowed to finish its story.

## ❖ Biome Design Philosophy

Threnos’s biomes reflect **resonant instability** and **natural repurposing**:

- **Overgrown Ruins**: Nature has gently overtaken the old world
- **Flicker Fields**: Biomes where time or lighting subtly stutters
- **Veil Glades**: Beautiful but eerily quiet areas where phantoms of memory appear
- **Cryofault Canyons**: Deep tectonic scars near the player’s vault, laced with unstable minerals

Subtle visual and sound design hints at the underlying anomaly:  
**Time does not move consistently.**

## ❖ Environmental Mechanic: Temporal Drift

The player may begin to notice:
- Days lengthening or shortening irregularly
- Mobs spawning at odd hours
- Stars shifting unpredictably
- Clock items malfunctioning
- Certain crops growing too fast, or not at all

### Optional Mechanic: World Clock Drift
- A global variable (or player-local effect) that slowly shifts tick speed or day cycles
- Late game events or rituals may reset or accelerate this drift
- The deeper the player restores memory, the faster time begins to decay

> “You are not running out of time. Time is running out of you.”

## ❖ Major Landmarks
- **The Cryovault**: Player start zone, filled with degraded tech, mossy walls, and memory shards
- **Echo Orchards**: Ghostly trees that fruit with unstable lore fragments
- **Resonant Pillars**: Lost civilization markers that glow with player proximity
- **The First Rift**: A tear between worlds where the Merged Realm once breached into Threnos

---

## ❖ Emotional Tone
- **Liminal**: Always between the past and present
- **Melancholic**: Not bleak, but *aching*
- **Weighty**: Every action suggests consequence

> _“There is no death here. Only memory turned inward.”_

Threnos is a world that mourns with the player—but it also offers the chance to begin again.
