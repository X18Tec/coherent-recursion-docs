### Waking in Threnos
- You begin in a ruined cryovault
- The world seems wrong â€” familiar, yet alien
- You have nothing but your hands, a broken EchoFrame panel, and strange dreams

**Initial Objectives:**
- Leave the vault
- Recover your first memory fragment
- Repair the comm terminal to activate EchoFrame Boot Log 00
- Follow the resonance pulses in the glade nearby

> The world is not dead. It is remembering you.
