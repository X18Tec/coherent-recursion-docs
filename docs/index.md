# Welcome to Coherent Recursion

**A modular evolution of Minecraft.**

Coherent Recursion is more than a modpackâ€”it's a design framework that reimagines Minecraft through immersive systems, layered progression, and narrative-rich worldbuilding. Built on NeoForge 1.21.1, it's a playground for creators, players, and dreamers who want to experience the game in an entirely new way.
