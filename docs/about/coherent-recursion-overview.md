# Coherent Recursion: Project Overview

## Project Vision
A **community-driven evolution of Minecraft**, centered on NeoForge 1.21.1. Coherent Recursion removes gameplay friction and replaces scattered vanilla systems with a **modular, progression-based architecture**. It offers a new foundation: extensible, curated, and rooted in intelligent design.

> **Developed by X18Tec** — creators of *Echoes of Aetherion* and *The Dimension Weaver*.

## Core Philosophy

- **Modular World Evolution**: Gameplay expands via unlockable modules
- **Remove Gameplay Noise**: Strip features that break immersion or progression
- **Respect the Player**: Challenge with meaning, not frustration
- **Design for Developers**: Build cleanly, document well, and maintain sanity
- **Narrative-Centric Design**: Use memory, resonance, and recursion as thematic cornerstones
- **Creative Sandbox Meets Survival Sim**: A world where thoughtful exploration is equally as viable as technological mastery or magical evolution

## Design Pillars

### 🧠 Player Psychology
- Inventory, death, and travel systems designed for immersion—not punishment
- Clear, discoverable player progression that respects curiosity and agency
- Tools, resources, and world systems evolve *with* the player, not in spite of them

### 🌐 Modular Infrastructure
- Modules are the heart of gameplay delivery, each tied to a narrative, biome, or technology
- Each module can be soft (additive) or hard (overwrites vanilla systems)
- Modules are categorized by alignment with one or more of the three paths: **Natura**, **Arcanum**, **Mechanica**

### 🎨 Aesthetic & Cultural Integration
- Biomes and builds matter. Architecture styles (e.g., Gothic, Elven, Brutalist) influence rituals, NPCs, and mechanics
- Cultural building materials tied to gameplay bonuses, resonances, and world reactions

---

## Key Systems & Needs Identified

### ⚠️ Friction Points (Vanilla Minecraft)
- Cluttered, shallow inventory systems
- Arbitrary progression walls (Smithing Templates, locked recipes)
- One-size-fits-all hostile mobs and item drops
- Disconnected biomes, flat procedural generation
- Underused building materials (e.g. copper)

### 💡 Planned Solutions
- Unified modular inventory/QoL system (backpacks, lunchboxes, auto-pickup)
- Mnemonic Tools: player-bound tools with memory and imprinting systems
- Lore-infused crafting systems with resonance influences
- Modular armor and weapon systems based on environment and threats
- Redefined farming, building, and animal interaction systems

---

## Removed/Disabled Vanilla Features

These mechanics and mobs break immersion or interfere with modular progression:

- Wandering Trader
- Armor Trims & Smithing Templates
- Brush mechanics (Sniffer/Armadillo)
- Pillagers/Raids
- Phantoms & Sleep punishment
- Dungeons, Spawners, and Warden
- Mob spawning above Y=0 (base world)
- Totems, brewing, vanilla magic
- Nether/End (replaced by modular dimensions)

---

## Community-Requested Systems to Include

- Vertical slabs and layered blocks
- Better inventory & storage mechanics
- Expanded biome integration & building variants
- Seasonal weather & agriculture
- Modular minecart/boat/travel improvements
- Biome- and dimension-specific mobs

## Future-Facing Module Concepts

| Module Name | Type | Systems | Unlock | Biome/Dim | Path |
|-------------|------|---------|--------|-----------|------|
| Memory Nexus | Core | Tools, ores, resonance | Start | Surface | Mechanica |
| Verdant Echoes | Expansion | Genetics, crops, rituals | Ritual | Temperate | Natura |
| Shadow Archive | Challenge | Combat, eldritch mobs | Key | Voidlands | Arcanum |
| Skybound Atlas | Late Game | Space/sci-fi tech, lore | Ascension | Sky realm | Mixed |
| Lorekeepers Guild | Knowledge | Journals, history, AI NPCs | Archives | Desert Ruins | All |

---

## Gameplay Genre Mapping

You are intentionally designing for diverse player styles:

- **Tech**: Modular machines, factory design, energy systems
- **Magic**: Resonance, rituals, attunements, crafting
- **Exploration**: Biome diversity, ruins, dimensional layers
- **Adventure/RPG**: Lore, quests, difficulty zones
- **Farming**: Resonant crops, seasonal cycles, animal symbiosis
- **Survival/Hardcore**: Realistic needs, strategic planning
- **Creative Sandbox**: Advanced building tools, microblocks

---

## What’s Missing / Consider Adding

| Area | Suggestion |
|------|------------|
| **Villager/NPC Rework** | NPC evolution or story-based factions with cultural identities |
| **Transportation** | Rail networks, dimensional boats, creature mounts |
| **UI/UX** | Custom HUD overlays for resonance, inventory, memory state |
| **Multiplayer Progression** | Synced anchors, co-op quest paths, server-wide module unlocks |
| **World State Changes** | Resonance events, biomes that bloom under auroras, evolving ruins |

---

## Next Steps

### ✅ Option 1: Module API Specification
- JSON + mod API system for module registration and gating
- Hooks for GUI, recipes, dimensions, and tool integration

### ✅ Option 2: Contributor Kit
- GitHub repo scaffold with CR Core pre-installed
- CONTRIBUTING.md, coding standards, and module creation starter pack

### ✅ Option 3: First Sample Module
- **"Memory Nexus"**: Tools, ores, and dimension intro
- Unlockable tool abilities, resonance crafting, Patchouli/quest tie-ins

---

## Final Statement

**Coherent Recursion is a modular evolution, not a modpack.**

It’s a platform for meaningful Minecraft design that restores intention to progression, immersion to exploration, and structure to creativity. Through resonance, memory, and narrative alignment, the world doesn’t just expand—it remembers.

Let’s build something worth remembering — together.
