# Coherent Recursion: Gameplay Friction → System Mapping

This doc connects core gameplay pain points in vanilla Minecraft ("frictions") to planned systems and modules within Coherent Recursion. Use this to:
- Guide design alignment
- Onboard contributors
- Prioritize system-building

---

## INVENTORY & MANAGEMENT

| Friction | Proposed System | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| Constant juggling of limited inventory slots | Modular backpack system, Mnemonic Tool inventory, auto-sorting pouches | Scales with progression |
| Manual eating breaks immersion | Lunchboxes, passive food slots, crop buffs | Farming modules boost utility |
| Too many tools for tasks | Memory Tools evolve with imprint slots | Specializations emerge via progression |

---

## CRAFTING & PROGRESSION

| Friction | Proposed System | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| Disconnected item progression (stone → diamond → netherite) | Unified Mnemonic Tool/Armor tree | Tools grow with player, not replaced |
| Arbitrary upgrade bottlenecks (e.g. Smithing Templates) | Restored legacy crafting paths or ritual-based unlocking | Crafting table remains meaningful throughout |
| Items with no recipes (e.g. saddle) | Add recipes via CR Core | Everything should be earnable |

---

## WORLD & BIOMES

| Friction | Proposed System | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| Harsh biome edges | Blended biome transitions via custom worldgen | Also improves exploration immersion |
| Repetitive terrain | Worldgen modules w/ height, feature, and cave variants | Different paths reveal different biomes |
| Missing aesthetic variety | Atlas of Styles module: architecture kits + build palettes | Elven, Gothic, Brutalist, etc. with gameplay ties |

---

## MOBS & COMBAT

| Friction | Proposed System | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| Generic hostiles everywhere | Dimensional Memory Mob system | Threats tied to location & player choices |
| Phantoms are annoying | Remove or repurpose via ritual events | Can become lore-linked nightmares |
| Combat lacks depth | Adaptive resistance system, boss mechanics | Tools/magic matter more than spam |

---

## FARMING & FOOD

| Friction | Proposed System | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| Flat crop mechanics | Resonance-based farming (Verdant Echoes) | Soil fertility, crop memory, weather effects |
| Animals are too simplistic | Ecological breeding, cross-biome traits | Passive mobs matter more than meat |
| No reason to farm long term | Food stat buffs, alchemy integration | Farming = progression, not filler |

---

## LORE & IMMERSION

| Friction | Proposed System | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| No built-in reason for anything | Memory flashes, Echo Archives, Patchouli docs | Progression becomes narrative-driven |
| No sense of world evolution | Aurora Engine & World State Manager | Aurora affects gameplay, changes world visually |
| Structures are static and meaningless | Modular ruins, Memory Anchors, ritual structures | Structures = progression + story beats |

---

## TRAVEL & DIMENSIONS

| Friction | Proposed System | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| Nether/End feel disconnected | Replaced with modular, lore-integrated realms | Unlock via Memory Nexus and ritual attunement |
| Travel gets tedious | Memory Waypoints, dimensional boats, modular minecarts | Visual and lore ties to transportation |
| No incentive to revisit old areas | Area-based resonance evolution, unlockable secrets | Progression loops encourage revisiting |

> "Every design decision stems from a single question: How can we make Minecraft more immersive, meaningful, and memorable—without losing its soul?"

This doc serves as a lens to ensure all future modules, mechanics, and additions serve player-centric design and the core principles of Coherent Recursion.
